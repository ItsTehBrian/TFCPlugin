# TFCPlugin
Hello! This is the repository for the main plugin developed for 
[The Floating City](https://thefloating.city), a unique Minecraft server where
you can build freely in creative, but in a void world, unable to fly. If that
sounds any interesting to you, consider giving the server a quick visit!

## Contributing
If you see any bugs, typos, or anything that can be improved, feel free to
submit a pull request or file an issue! I welcome even the smallest issues
and nitpicks.

The source code follows IntelliJ IDEA's default code style, with some minor
deviations, which are:
- No wildcard imports.
- Always use braces, the only exception being single line if statements.

In general, please just try to follow the code style of the rest of the project.
 
The project uses ACF for commands, so if you'd like to contribute commands, 
I recommend [reading up a bit on it first](https://github.com/aikar/commands/wiki).
