# Hello!
This is the repository for the private plugin developed for the Minecraft server, The Floating City. It's a creative building, no fly, one of a kind niche server. The IP for the server is `thefloating.city`, and if you're ever looking for a unique server with a friendly playerbase, consider checking it out!

## Why is this public?
This repository used to be private, however I've made it public so that others can learn from the code, and also contribute to the server. I realize that publicizing it might encourage others to try to steal from the server's codebase but I have good faith in the community, and additionally, it's not like the code is top tier anyway. I'm just a single developer so I'd appreciate any help I can get.

## Sole developer? Who are you?
Hi there! I'm Brian. Before The Floating City, I did some cool things like dabbling with music production, pixel art, programming, vector art, and anything else I could get my hands on. Now, I do all of those things, but I also work on The Floating City!

## How did the server get started?
I made a housing on Hypixel that players could freely build in, but without creative-style fly. There was also a little parkour you had to complete to get building permissions. It was quite fun! Along the way, I ran into a player named Armature, and he said this would be cool as an actual server and he knows a guy who can make it a reality. He introduced me to Nyarrth who is a developer and also happened to own some physical servers. Teaming up with the two, this server became a reality!

## Nyarrth? Armature? How's the team?
Armature helps with the forums, website, and brainstorming ideas for the server. Nice guy! Without him this server wouldn't be possible because he's what united the gang.

Nyarrth is the sysadmin for the server. He owns the physical servers and does all the maintenance. P.S. He's a really swell guy, so if you would like to get in touch to maybe rent some servers, check out his [GitHub](https://github.com/Nyarrth)!

And I'm.. well you know me.

## Alright, so how can I contribute?
If you see any bugs, typos, or anything that can be improved, feel free to submit a pull request or file an issue. I welcome even the smallest issues or nitpicks. The source code follows IntelliJ IDEA's default code style, with some minor deviations, which are:
- No wildcard imports.
- Always use braces, the only exception is single line if statements.

No weird brackets here! I use ACF for commands so if you'd like to contribute commands, I recommend [reading up a bit on it](https://github.com/aikar/commands/wiki) first.

## Anything else?
Nope, that's about it. Feel free to take a peek around, maybe file a few issues, or just stop and say hi.
