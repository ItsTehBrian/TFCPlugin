# Hello!
This is the repository for the private plugin developed for the Minecraft server, The Floating City. It's a creative building, no fly, one of a kind unique niche server. The IP for the server is `thefloating.city`, and if you're ever looking for a unique server with a friendly playerbase, consider checking us out!

## Why is this public?
This repository used to be private, however I've made it public so that others can learn from the code, and also contribute to the server. I realize that publicizing it might encourage others to try to steal from the server's codebase but I have good faith in the community, and additionally, it's not like the code is top tier anyway. I'm just a sole developer so I'd appreciate any help I can get.

## Sole developer? Who are you?
Hi there! I'm Brian. I had an idea for a housing back on Hypixel Housing, where I made a housing that players can build in, but not fly in, and a little parkour you have to complete to get building permissions. It was quite fun! I ran into a player named armature, and he said he knows a guy who can make this server a reality. He introduced me to Nyarrth who is a developer and also happened to own some servers. Teaming up with the two, this server became a reality!

## Nyarrth? Armature? How's the team?
Armature helps with the forums, website, and brainstorming ideas for the server. Nice guy! Without him this server wouldn't be anything because he's what united the gang.

Nyarrth is the sys admin for this server. He owns the physical servers and does all the maintenance. (P.S. he's a really swell guy, so if you would like to get in touch to maybe rent some servers, check out his [GitHub](https://github.com/Nyarrth))

And I'm.. well you know me.

## Alright, so how can I contribute?
If you see any bugs, typos, or anything that can be improved, feel free to submit a pull request or file an issue. Even the smallest minute issues or nitpicks, I welcome. I try as much as possible to adhere to the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). No weird brackets here! I use ACF for commands so if you'd like to contribute commands, I recommend [reading up a bit on it](https://github.com/aikar/commands/wiki) first.

## Anything else?
Nope, that's about it. Feel free to take a peek around, maybe file a few issues, or just stop and say hi.
